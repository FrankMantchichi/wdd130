                <img src="images/Malawi.png" alt="Lake Malawi">
                <p>Malawi, a landlocked country in southeastern Africa, is celebrated for its warm hospitality 
                    and vibrant culture. Its diverse population comprises various ethnic groups, with the Chewa,
                     Nyanja, Tumbuka, and Yao being among the largest. Traditional customs and rituals continue 
                     to shape daily life, alongside Christianity, which is widely practiced. Malawians are known 
                     for their resilience and community spirit, often seen in the cooperative farming practices 
                     prevalent across the country. The rhythm of life revolves around family, community gatherings, 
                     and festivities, where music and dance are integral expressions of cultural identity. Despite 
                     facing economic challenges, the people of Malawi maintain a strong sense of unity and optimism,
                      embodying the nation's motto: "Unity and Freedom."</p>
